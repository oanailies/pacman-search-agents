# Artificial Intelligence Search Agents

**Author:** Ilies Oana-Elena  
**Faculty:** Faculty of Automation and Computer Science  
**Project Type:** Academic AI Coursework (Pacman Search Projects)  

This repository includes implementations and explanations of multiple search strategies and intelligent agents used to solve problems within a maze-based Pacman environment. The goal is to navigate Pacman efficiently to reach objectives such as collecting food, visiting corners, or avoiding ghosts using classical AI techniques.

## Project Title

Intelligent Search Strategies for Pacman in Maze Environments

## Implemented Algorithms

### Project 1 – Search

1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
3. Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
4. A* Search
5. Corners Problem (Reach all 4 corners)
6. Corners Heuristic
7. Food Search Problem
8. Suboptimal Search (Closest food)

### Project 2 – Multi-Agent Search

1. Reflex Agent
2. Minimax Agent
3. Alpha-Beta Pruning
4. Expectimax Agent
5. Better Evaluation Function

## How to Run

1. Clone the project and install the Pacman framework from UC Berkeley’s CS188 (or integrate it into your environment).
2. Run specific search projects using:python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=depthFirstSearch



## Highlights

- Demonstrates classical AI search strategies
- Includes both uninformed and informed search
- Combines heuristics and cost-based reasoning
- Implements both single-agent and multi-agent decision-making

## Applications

- Game AI and pathfinding
- Search-based reasoning
- Decision trees in adversarial settings
- Foundational reinforcement learning structure
